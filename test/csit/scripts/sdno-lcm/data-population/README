import_data_to_esr_brs.pl:
A script for registering network controllers to External System Resistration (ESR) and populating network devices (managed elements) into BRS.
It first registers network controllers to ESR and remembers controller id returned by ESR.
It then injects these controller ids into corresponding managed-element's meta data.
Finally, managed elements with correct controller id will be created in BRS.


Controllers.json: 
One sample of network controller meta-data
It should be changed based on the network scenario to be tested.


ManagedElements.json: 
One sample of managed elwment meta-data
It should be changed based on the network scenario to be tested.
